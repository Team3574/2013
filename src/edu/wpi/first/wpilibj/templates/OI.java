    //// CREATING BUTTONS
    // One type of button is a joystick button which is any button on a joystick.
    // You create one by telling it which joystick it's on and which button
    // number it is.
    // Joystick stick = new Joystick(port);
    // Button button = new JoystickButton(stick, buttonNumber);
    
    Joystick stick = new Joystick(1);
    
    Button b1 = new JoystickButton(stick, 1);
    Button b2 = new JoystickButton(stick, 2);
    Button b3 = new JoystickButton(stick, 3);
    Button b4 = new JoystickButton(stick, 4);
    
    // Another type of button you can create is a DigitalIOButton, which is
    // a button or switch hooked up to the cypress module. These are useful if
    // you want to build a customized operator interface.
    // Button button = new DigitalIOButton(1);
    
    // There are a few additional built in buttons you can use. Additionally,
    // by subclassing Button you can create custom triggers and bind those to
    // commands the same as any other Button.
    
    //// TRIGGERING COMMANDS WITH BUTTONS
    // Once you have a button, it's trivial to bind it to a button in one of
    // three ways:
    
    // Start the command when the button is pressed and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
    // button.whenPressed(new ExampleCommand());
    
    // Run the command while the button is being held down and interrupt it once
    // the button is released.
    // button.whileHeld(new ExampleCommand());
    
    // Start the command when the button is released  and let it run the command
    // until it is finished as determined by it's isFinished method.
    // button.whenReleased(new ExampleCommand());
